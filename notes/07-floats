FlðŸŽˆats - let things stack horizontally instead of vertically
Clearing Floats - don't want any elements beside the floated element; everything should start below it

Inline boxes are aligned with the text-align property
Percentages are relative to the width of the parent element

Avoid class names that refer to appearance
Universal truth of CSS layouts - everything is a box inside of a box inside of another box
